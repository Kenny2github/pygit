# Pygit
A re-implementation of Git in Python.

Some notes:
- This implementation is not compatible with regular Git; it is a separate execution of the same idea.
- Like many of my projects, I am doing this only to prove to myself that I can, not because it is useful.
- This will almost certainly be a permanent work in progress.
